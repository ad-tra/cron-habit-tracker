## Overview

This Rust-based habit tracker is built on [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). Unlike traditional habit trackers, it allows you to specify the target frequency of your habits using the powerful Cron syntax. 

## Features

- **Cron Syntax**: Specify habit schedules using Cron-like expressions, providing fine-grained control over habit tracking.

- **Retro Aesthetic**: Enjoy a fun and nostalgic retro aesthetic that adds a unique charm to your habit tracking experience.

- **Productivity Map**: Visualize your habit completion progress with a productivity map inspired by GitHub contribution map.

- **Customizable**: Tailor the habit tracker to your preferences with customizable colors.

- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Rust, the habit tracker is compatible with various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project using Rust's package manager. `cargo run` 
3. [Create a lockbook account](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook/)
4. Login by pasting your lockbook account key
5. Customize your habit schedules, explore the retro aesthetic, and track your progress.

## Contributing

I originally developed this app as a take-home project for Lockbook. The code quality might not be top-notch as I was on a tight deadline, and I didn't have any prior experience with Rust or egui. 
Feel free to throw in your bug reports, feature ideas, or even some code tweaks through pull requests. We're all in this together!
