# Habit Tracker - Built With Rust 
During the span of 4 weeks I was challenged to create a crud app in Rust using egui. Sounds easy? Yeah, simple crud apps are easy to write, the only issue is that I knew 0 Rust and 0 egui, a fresh gui library.  

To pull this off, time management was crucial, so here's how I split my weeks:
- week 1: read the rust book
- week 2: messed around with egui and started building non interactive ui
- week 3: made the ui interactive and implemnted all crud operations.
